                    The history of "Balmuzdak" LLP dates back to 1987, when a cooperative for the production of ice cream was created on the basis of a small workshop that was subordinate to the Association of Catering Enterprises, then the Lengersky District Consumer Union. As a private company, Balmuzdak LLP was formed in March 1998, by buying out the existing property of the ice cream shop from the Regional Consumer Union. In those years, the collapse of the consumer cooperation system began, enterprises and organizations with a private form of ownership began to appear, through which the government set a goal to raise the country's economy, saturate the market with everyday goods, and at that time it was formed on the basis of the purchased ice cream shop — Balmuzdak LLP, which was founded with a 100% ownership share by an entrepreneur with many years of experience Adahan Nadyrovich Turdiev. It was the first private production of ice cream in the South Kazakhstan region.

                <div class="text_history">
                    Pasteurization is a preservation method. By heating the dairy ingredients (milk and cream) to a specific temperature for a pre-defined duration you kill off a lot of micro organisms. By reducing the amount of micro organisms (pasteurization never removes all of them), you increase the shelf life of the product. Also, pasteurization will kill off most of the pathogenic micro organisms, those that make you sick, making the ice cream safe for consumption.

                <div class="text_history">
                    Apart from the safety aspect, pasteurization is done for quality purposes as well. Pasteurization of the ice cream also prevents milk fat in the cream from becoming rancid through oxidation by breaking off enzymes which catalyze the reaction.
                    And there’s another benefit of pasteurization. The heat treatment will help the proteins in the milk to hydrate. The heat will partially unfold the proteins which makes it easier for the protein to hydrate and bind to water.

                <div class="title_history">Cooling, aging & freezing </div> 
            
                <div class="text_history">
                    The pasteurized mixture then has to cool down. It is cooled down to 0-4ºC, so above freezing temperature. At this point, no air is yet introduced, it is really all about cooling down and getting ready for the next step of freezing and aeration. The mix should be cooled fast enough to make sure no growth of some left over micro organisms will take place. With pasteurization not all micro organisms are killed off, so it is still important to treat the mix carefully.

                    If an ice cream manufacturer wants to add ingredients which are sensitive to heat (e.g. fruits) this will be done once the ice cream has cooled down.
